**Please note: The framework is currently under develpment. But we are close to the first MVP release!**

## What is Foxtrot?

![](https://github.com/gquagliano/foxtrot-framework/wiki/img/editor.jpg)

Foxtrot is a rapid web and mobile app development framework, featuring a **visual editor** which integrates a JavaScript frontend with a headless PHP backend, and one that aims to be the **easiest** *cross-platform-ultra-lightweight-all-in-one-framework* to learn and use.

We have took the compromise to create **a framework that's not like all the others**, one that **doesn't overload** either the developer's head, the system or the client's device; one where **almost no configuration** is required, that is **super-easy** to use, and that was written in **almost-human** language.

It's important for us as well **to promote the proper language learning and writint** for PHP and (specially) JavaScript, understanding and empowring the correct usage of classes (PHP) and the JavaScript prototype over any other pattern. That's why Foxtrot **doesn't have pseudo-classes or a virutal DOM**, just *(so, so many)* utilities to shorten and automate the most common processes in the interaction between the user and the UI, and between client and server.

## Where's the code

This repo is **for the english version of the docs *only***. We're translating the docs and they will be pushed soon.
